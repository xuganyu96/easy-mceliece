# Easy McEliece
Classic McEliece's reference and optimized implementations:

- [ ] Perhaps maintain namespacing so that different variants can be run in the same program
- [ ] Remove extraneous dependencies, especially with regard to Keccak and `randombytes.c`
- [ ] Compile into static and/or shared library
- [ ] Take apart the original implementation so that the OW-CPA subroutines can be exposed
